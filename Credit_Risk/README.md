### Module 20 Challenge
Name: Andrea Wu

## Objective
In this Challenge, you’ll use various techniques to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk. You’ll use a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.

Please run the credit_risk_classification.ipynb for the Logistic Regression Model.

Library used: numpy, pandas, pathlib, sklearn.metrics, sklearn.linear_model

Please make sure you install all the library before you run the code.
